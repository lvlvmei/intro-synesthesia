    <h3>Vassily Kandinsky</h3>
    <p>Composition VI</p>
    <p>
      Kandinsky spent nearly six months preparing to create this painting, at first intending the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction and rebirth all at the same time. Gabrielle Munter, his assistant at the time, told him that he was blocked, and he needed to release himself from his intellectual trappings surrounding the painting. She suggested that he simply repeat the word “uberflut,” meaning “flood” or “deluge,” focusing on the sound of the word rather than its meaning, releasing his mind from the artistic block and focusing only on the music of the word.

    <p>Vision</p>
    <p>
      "One day, many years ago, I was having an acupuncture treatment and was lying fl at on my back, on a futon, stuck full of needles. My eyes were shut and I watched intently, as I always do, hoping to see something magical, which does not always occur. Sometimes what I see is just not interesting or beautiful. Lying there, I watched the soft, undulating, black background I always see when I shut my eyes become pierced by a bright red colour that began to form in the middle of the rich velvet blackness. The red began as a small dot of intense colour and grew quite large rather quickly, chasing much of the blackness away. I saw green shapes appear in the midst of the red colour and move around the red and black fi elds. This is the fi rst vision that I painted exactly as I saw it."

    <p>Radiohead – Lucky</p>
    <p>Missouri-based artist Melissa McCracken paints music. McCracken's vivid paintings stem from her desire to capture her daily experiences so that others can understand the brilliant, saturated world she inhabits. Until the age of 15, McCracken thought that everyone lived in the same hue-rich, dynamic realm of color that she had known since birth. “Basically, my brain is cross-wired,” she explains regarding her synesthesia.

    <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
    <p>Starry Night</p>
    <p>Vincent Van Gogh explained in his letters that for him, sounds had colors and that certain colors, like yellow and blue, were like fireworks for his senses. His paintings Sunflowers and The Starry Night are still palpitating canvases endowed with life and movement. It’s clear now that the famous post-impressionist genius was synesthetic.</p>

    <h3>Wassily Kandinski</h3>
    <p>The Lyrical</p>
    <p>Vasily Kandinsky's self-described "musical album," Klänge (Sounds), consists of thirty-eight prose-poems he wrote between 1909 and 1911 and fifty-six woodcuts he began in 1907. In the woodcuts Kandinsky veiled his subject matter, creating increasingly indecipherable images (though the horse and rider, his symbol for overcoming objective representation, runs through as a leitmotif). This process proved crucial for the development of abstraction in his art.

    <p>All the Love in the World - Nine Inch Nails</p>
    <p>Her oil and acrylic paintings express snippets of the dizzyingly spectacular sights she sees and hears each day. Inspired by certain songs, the works of art burst with texture and splashes of polychromatic delight. To get a better sense of what the artist experienced as she created each painting, click the song title beneath each image to listen to the music that inspired such gorgeous works.

    <p>Amsterdam-based artist Daniel Mullen explores how people with synesthesia experience the world, with an ongoing painting series, titled Synesthesia. Each incredible piece is meticulously painted with a steady hand, rendered in bright, rainbow hues. Each piece represents how Engelman experiences various times.</p>

    <h3>Marcia Smilack</h3>
    <p>Cello Music</p>
    <p>This unique artist/photographer, who calls herself a “Reflectionist,” uses her synesthesia to tell her when to snap the shutter as soon as she sees, hears, and feels sounds and textures in reflections on water. She thinks of the wind as the paintbrush, the surface of the water her canvas, and her camera the instrument by which she records her observations. She never manipulates a picture after taking it. The list of titles she wrote for her pictures reads like poetry.</p>

    <h3>Joan Mitchell</h3>
    <p>Sunflowers</p>
    <p>Throughout her life she referred to sunflowers in her paintings; she said of them, “[they] are like people to me.” The bloom of the sunflower has a particularly concentrated mass. Pushed upward on tall, spindly stalks, it blossoms, droops, falls apart and fades. Mitchell’s late sunflower paintings reflect the feeling of the flower’s life cycle: its immense gathering of energy into the brightly colored flower and its subsequent dissipation

    <h3>Krista Harris</h3>
    <p>Deep South</p>
    <p>Synesthesia is a sensation that some people have when one sense is being interpreted by a different one. Some people see a color when a number is mentioned. Others smell a lemon when they see a particular shade of green. Artist Krista Harris has incorporated this sensory phenomenon into her abstract art. She lives in rural Colorado which creates a perfect backdrop for inspiration through all five senses. For example, when she hears a blackbird singing she attempts to paint that sound. Krista’s art and her way of approaching the senses and the world around her is fascinating. Check out my exciting interview with her on this episode of Savvy Painter!</p>

    <h3>Anne Salz</h3>
    <p>Vivaldi</p>
    <p>Artist Anne Salz painted Vivaldi while listening to The Concerto of Four Violins. While painting she captures the movement, energy, and sound of the music. “The painting represents the opening of the concerto for four violins. I listen to the music while I paint. First, the music gives me an optimistic, happy feeling and I perceive red, yellow, and orange colors in a great variety with little contrast. It looks like a field of these colors. I perceive the color field as a musical chord. You can compare it with the colors of a blanket or cover made of autumn leaves……The lively movements in the music become a stream of glowing shades of orange. The black structure provides cadence and reveals its significance and character. It is an indispensable foundation for the moving colors. The painting evokes my feelings again when I listen to the music again. I hear the melodies in my mind when I look at it.”</p>

    <h3> Richard E. Cytowic</h3>
    <p>Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia</p>
    <p>In Wednesday Is Indigo Blue, pioneering researcher Richard Cytowic and distinguished neuroscientist David Eagleman explain the neuroscience and genetics behind synesthesia's multisensory experiences. Because synesthesia contradicted existing theory, Cytowic spent twenty years persuading colleagues that it was a real—and important—brain phenomenon rather than a mere curiosity. </p>

    <p> “Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see—the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on.” </p>

    <p>5132-5097 AD</p>
    <p>Mullen’s artwork looks like three-dimensional sheets of colorful plexiglass, arranged in geometric rows and sequences. "I would visually place my work somewhere between geometric abstraction and the Light and Space movement of California. I’m interested in phenomenology—to sense something that is not present, or at least that which seems undefinable, a space out of reach beyond our perception,”</p>
